# Hi there, I'm Rohith! 👋

### 🚀 From Marketing Mind to Code Craftsman

> *"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."* - That's exactly how I felt about coding.

I'm a **passionate full-stack developer** who traded marketing campaigns for code commits. After 2 years in marketing, I discovered my true calling in technology and embarked on an intensive 7-month self-learning journey that transformed me into a developer ready to build the future.
