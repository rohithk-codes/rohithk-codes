### ‚ú® Hello World! I'm Rohith.

**From Market Insights to Code Architect: Building the Future, One Line at a Time.**

My journey into tech isn't typical, and that's precisely my superpower. Armed with an MBA from Kerala Technological University and two years navigating the dynamic world of marketing, I discovered a profound, undeniable pull towards technology. It wasn't just an interest; it was a calling.

Over the past 7 months, I've channeled that passion into an intense, self-driven deep dive into full-stack development. I've embraced the challenge, transforming theoretical knowledge into tangible, impactful projects. My background in understanding user needs and business strategy now gives me a unique edge in crafting solutions that aren't just functional, but truly resonate.
